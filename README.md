# Starter Component Library

This project serves as a starter component library for new projects.

## Powered by Fractal

The component library is built with [Fractal](http://fractal.build) ([docs](http://fractal.build/guide), [API](http://fractal.build/api)).
Fractal is essentially a static site generator optimized for building and sharing design components. Component templates are written in [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/).

## Installation

> `npm install`

## Starting the Library

> `npm start`

By default, the Fractal server will run at `http://localhost:3000`.
