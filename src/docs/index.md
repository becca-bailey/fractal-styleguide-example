title: Starter Component Library
---

This is a starter component library for a new project. It contains a starter [design tokens](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/tokens-in-design-systems-25dd82d58421) file, styles for common elements, and commonly used components and icons.

## Technical Details

* Component templates are written in [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), with data passed via JSON.
* SCSS has been structured using [ITCSS](http://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/manage-large-css-projects-itcss-101517528).
* Compiled CSS is piped through [autoprefixer](https://autoprefixer.github.io). Vendor prefixes and older syntaxes are added automatically.
